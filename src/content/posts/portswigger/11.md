The most effective way to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities is to avoid passing user-supplied input to filesystem APIs altogether.

If you can't avoid passing user-supplied input to filesystem APIs, we recommend using two layers of defense to prevent attacks: 
- Validate the user input before processing it. Ideally, compare the user input with a whitelist of permitted values. If that isn't possible, verify that the input contains only permitted content, such as alphanumeric characters only.
- After validating the supplied input, append the input to the base directory and use a platform filesystem API to canonicalize the path. Verify that the canonicalized path starts with the expected base directory.
