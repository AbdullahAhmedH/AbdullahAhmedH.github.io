If an application has safeguards against using /../, try using absolute path. You may be able to bypass it.

**Lab** : Intercept the website's images with burpsuite, choose an image or two, and modify the filename parameter to etc/passwd

You might also be able to use nested traversal sequences if a safeguard against traversal exists- such as ....// or 
....\/. These revert to simple traversal sequences when the inner sequence is stripped.

**Lab** : Use ....//....//....//etc/passwd as an input to the same filename parameter.

In some cases, web servers strip your traversal. To bypass this, encode the ../ characters. This results in 
%2e%2e%2f  or  in case of a double encoding %252e%252e%252f 
Non standard encodings include ..%c0%af or ..%ef%bc%8f

**Lab** : Used ..%252f..%252f..%252fetc/passwd as input. 

An application may require the user-supplied filename to start with the expected base folder, such as /var/www/images. 

In this case, it might be possible to include the required base folder followed by suitable traversal sequences. For example: filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd.

**Lab** : Used /var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd

You might have a file extension expected. In that case, terminate it using %00

**Lab** : Used ../../../etc/passwd%00.png
