SSRFs are attacks that allow attackers to create requests to unintended places within the server. 
If a certain feature makes requests to the server for harmless data, and if that feature could be tampered with, it could make requests to the server for more harmful information.

If a request is being made- for example:
```html
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://stock.weliketoshop.net:8080/product/stock/
```
You can modify it to instead return- 
```html
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://localhost/admin
```

This could end up granting access to admin console as server requests are implicitly trusted. 

**Lab** : Use stockAPI parameter using Burpsuite Proxy to access the admin interface. Check the url used to delete a user- i.e /admin/delete?username=carlos. Pass the url http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos through the stockAPI parameter to perform delete operation- as the server is trusted implicitly. 

In some cases, the application server is able to interact with back-end systems that are not directly reachable by users. These systems often have non-routable private IP addresses.

**Lab** : Using the stockAPI parameter, use Burpsuite Intruder to find the missing value in the given incomplete IP to see which is valid for /admin. Use that IP to delete carlos.
