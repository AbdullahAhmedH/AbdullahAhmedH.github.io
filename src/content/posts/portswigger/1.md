<p>
Path traversal, also known as directory traversal, is a potential attack surface that attempts to read, write or alter 
files existing on the server of a website. 
Files can contain sensitive data like app code, credentials, os files.
</p>
<p>
We can access the files through html attributes, or through the URL itself.
</p>

**Lab** : Intercept the request for an image using BurpSuite, edit the url parameter to '../../../etc/passwd'
This is assuming that we have to step up three directories to access etc.
