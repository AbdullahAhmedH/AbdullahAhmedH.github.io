When a website allows you to upload files without enforcing restrictions and validating name, type, content and size, it can be used to upload dangerous files that could pose a risk. 

Specifically, php one-liners are used. 

```php
<?php echo file_get_contents('/path/to/target/file'); ?>

<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
```

**Lab** : Create a .php file with the contents 

```php
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
```
Sign in as wiener and upload the file as your profile picture. Once you go back to the initial page, you will find that the "image" cannot be displayed. Open Burpsuite proxy and check HTTP history. You'll find php as an extension. The response of it will contain ygXoETutoooROj9X2bDtapcYv6uBigzH. Submit as solution.

Change the value of the MIME header that attempts to validate file type. 

**Lab** : Use the same php file as earlier. In a similar process, when you try to upload the file, it will reject the file because the Content-Type comes under application/octet-stream. Change it to image/jpeg and forward it. Follow the same steps as earlier.
