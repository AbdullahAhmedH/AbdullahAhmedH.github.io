## Overview

The **Web Vulnerability Scanner** is a Python-based application designed to scan websites for common web vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Directory Traversal. It provides a minimalistic interface using PyQt5, real-time progress updates, and detailed vulnerability reports, which can be exported as PDF.
